# Xerox-Sales
A project on the sales made by Xerox.

The task was to build an application for Xerox's mediated sales.
1. The system must allow dynamic range pricing (floor,traget,ceiling). 
2. The range of price shown to the salesperson will be different depending on the market the customer belongs to by categorizing 
customers by the market.they are in. 
For example, from Xeroxâ€™ view point, NU is in the higher education marketThe price ranges for NU are very different from those of a bank
in the financial services market.
3. The application supports the ability to read sales automatically.
